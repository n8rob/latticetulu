i am feeling relaxed
two years ago before my parents passed away
windows are open man
i dont have the money
dont be too ambitious
how are you asif
then why didnt you play
i dont know why lets go and find out
why work against the law when the law is with you
youve got  lakhs
oy oy give the money give the money
after the half time
poor children
were definitely playing kabadi
how can you if they turned off the lights peter
what was there to drink
pull up your socks and get going
govinda govinda
i didnt understand if he was encouraging us or the opposite
i always respected brother pandu
only  raid is left
should we raise the stakes to  blind
brother bhaskar  rounds rest of you  roundscome on
he wouldve asked for his clothes back
bhaskar has rejoined the mamus boys
lets practice once what have we got to lose
if you people join then it might provide some comedy
but unfortunately he loses
you fooled us
if youre with us then quit drinking
bhaskar where is your wife
that i wont lie to my father
it okay leave it
they may not come
he said that he will give  lakhs right
no i wont
is this how you talk to your coach
what is this am i a football
of course
anyhow wish you all the best
he never gave me that opportunity
i cant take another beating from them
poor grandfather had to spend all his lifesavings on hospital bills
just because i skipped that day ive been regretful for  years
now you know how it feels to lose
how about that wada
we havent played for thirty years
everythings over now
you better pay first i dont trust you
how come you are here how come
but we do play well sir our old team has regrouped sir
are you going to play
for urwa kings total  points
in ones life friends are the most valuable gifts
left right
oh my god shes killed me im dead
good good
are we coming tomorow
couldnt find anything smaller
now from urwa kings its turn to raid
uncle even you are laughing at me right
can i join you boys
its not enough if you just have strength in your body
no i feel as if i am playing in shade
we hope that he is not hurt
i miss those days
with  seconds left both the teams have got  points each
do we also need to run  rounds
uncle if he had to ask god for anything
difficult too difficult not as easy as we all thought
funny feeling in the stomach again
both captains come forward
where has bhaskar died today
okay ive understood your situation
good get ready
really
I have added two new buses this year
i dont know what to do
theres no problem right
third raid from boys
if you want to be a good father
isnt there a difference in running and drinking
all he wanted to do
you will be a coward
sit down
its been  months that my wife and son have left
today evening
today we are playing not just for the sake of cafe
i dont find it safe feels risky
so if we assemble a team train them and if they win
i pay you a salary right do whatever you want with that money
 seen
how are you
and urwa kings owner madhav has also joined the team
i could improve your grandfathers business
he said that hell help you guys
sounds like a herd of goats
unlock the door
your grandfather killed us
thats why i always say
i have been working here for the past  years
just have your breakfast
im happy that youre playing
do as your heart says
what is it
this is not just about money
even i dont know who i came with at night
give him the cash
so lets do one thing ill get you some sugar
yes he was my opposition teams coach
nowadays even im doubting it
everybody is here how are you all
please dont take it lightly
he gave me strength
raghu how are you
mamus boys get one more point
he came in front of my car
raider has won the first point
I would lose track of time
on top of that a dog started chasing me
i left the game  years ago
im trying to do body building
what mischief are you boys up to today
then you come let them sit there
i know
on four percent interest
where has your spirit gone
gautham had called to meet up at the cafe
the cafes documents are in his possession
okay dad bye
last  minutes to go
your idea is the best talk at kudla caf tomorrow
is this a day to be late idiot
bhaskar  point means  lakhs
ke it down here ill come up in my own time
how about kudla warriors
but now i am very happy
lets go and tell the referee
i didnt know well have to do all this
i feel sorry for his situation
bye gautham
so urwa kings will raid first
spoil the mood
which money
thank you sir
even if you drink gamble
i will do it peter what will i get in return
children suffer for the sins of elders
next we will learn how to win
successful tackle by the second man
now the urwa kings owner madhav is going for his first raid
at least for kudla caf we have to win this match
oh okay dad
peter take him to the hospital
search for a new coach
i guarantee were going to lose
i love my daughter i love you too
hey let him finish first continue gautham
hey raghu catch his leg
then gautums  lakh
what a fool bhaskar is he is done for
wait for some more time
ill not repeat the same mistake dad
yes still alive what do you want now
totally 
ill not play
touch your feet properly
not  lakhs
i am your new coach
raghu
let her go wherever she wants
didnt i ask you not to poke your nose when elders are talking
toss won by boys
dont call it a waste peter
first clear the exams
dont leave us in between
we thank all the sports fans attending this program
look at that one more point
how many times do i have to tell you
see call them
check the winning amount
is brain working
we will manage you should go
do what i say
this time i wont allow it
since ive come here you people have been speaking nonsense
start showing interest or forget about it okay
unbelievable sight as the strong danny captain of urwa kings is tackled by mamus boys
when he wished us luck
but there is an urgent meeting with a showroom investor
your daughter has many questions
aasif kishore
brother raghu
but theres no place for sentiments in this field
how about we make money thi
your grandfathers loan is going to give us arthritis
in your family life
do you know the meaning of warriors
what difficulty i dont have that much
show
well how are we going to play kabaddi at this age
then how i find it difficult
why cant you start playing again
but you are not receiving the call
bhaskar do you know where he is
what do i do for a living
ours isnt a professional team
urwa kings yadhav has got in now
she has gone to her mothers
boys are playing really well in the second half
pandu uncle was mad or what
pooja go change
why werent you with them last night
what did you say
brother kishore you go first
come sit on my bike
you embarrass me
raghu listen
you guys are quite something arent you
i feel bad for the kid
after all the prize money for winners is 
kishore
come lets go let us go
this place must be valued at  lakhs at least
now its upto the golden raid
i trust you people
and hes crossed the line
boys unable to show yesterdays spirit
 lakhs
get off me
 only if the raider scores a point will they proceed to the finals
what is this are we playing carrom
it might be good
you will surely lose the money
the finals would have kept him awake
what do i give you now
an amazing attempt
everyone doesnt have to raid right
bhaskar be steady you can do it
now referee will flip the coin
okay ill take your leave
i will play
come on boys come on
book is this a place to ask for a book
i will not give the money
the most awaited final match will begin in few more minutes
okay okay coming
okay i will leave now wont come back again
you mustve joined as a janitor
raghu you should never say that
no
well come to know their fate just within  seconds
but i didnt think well be out of touch so badly
in fact he would advise against borrowing money from friends
why why i
raghu is finding it difficult 
be strong and dont be scared
i am sorry
its easy to kill a mosquito it seems
lets go quickly lets go
he is still not here
finally he took a loan from madhav
and its been a while right
urwa kings get  extra points
okay
i asked for a good name
i wont even touch alcohol
im in great difficulty it is a matter of my reputation
its okay let it be we force anyone
i wouldve got national level
right gautham

you serve in plates right why are you serving me a newspaper
why is he on the floor
hey easy
hey
who are they your lawyers

so what should we do
he didnt like it
how to lie to your parents

but she has faith thats enough
he wont disclose anything to anyone
but i blew the horn
your grandfather

highest
now he has to repay almost  lakhs
you are a pt teacher right
urwa kings are defending in    formation

youll always do as your father says
im requesting you
but if you still want to go
do you have other options to make  lakhs in such a short period
and what if you dont pay back
theyll win a kabadi match
bhaskars sports team
brother bhaskar will you listen to me come up
first raid after half time is from bhaskar

hes right raghu
but you couldve met mom even if you played

i think it is enough right
in pandu uncles memory
where will you sit
for the cafe to be closed for one day
it is all good
but not in his house go to some hotel
look there is no point talking about the past
boys vs kesari kodikere game has been a draw
if he were here he wouldve said that
what if that day bhaskar would have forgiven me
yeah get lost
and the good news is
i had a full bottle these two shared one i even finished the last  ml
oh really even pooja is the best raider in the team
he loses it when hes drunk
people will have a good laugh at our expense
i married her you were born

but we need to think practically
he asked you to stop right
must be still asleep
bygones be bygones
tomorrow  am means sharp  am
how does it matter whether a boy or a girl coaches you
our team is missing one thing
he touches both players and crosses the line easily

pandu uncle was always like a master for us
and never controlled me
you know him right
yeah okay
its not necessary for us to win
where is bhaskar

what kind of questions are you asking
if he repeats it a then madhav might get a yellow card
so in total they have  points

but do you people have an idea about the game
grandpa

aasif im glad you guys came
with  teams in each group

get up get up
this trophy will be mine
he usually gets others depressed
do you know what brother bhaskar said about you
here get down
he used to listen to whatever i said
i doubt he will come
why did you come now
weve reached the finals but youre still not playing your real game
you hide then i seek i hide then you seek this is life
oh parked it so far up front huh
referee has called captains of both the teams
not assembling another team
you can sleep on the kabadi ground itself
see you at practice
federal bank final match will begin in few moments
shell do something
all the best for your match
even if your bones became powder you never felt bad
weve to save him anyhow right
was i supposed to get a dream that he will come so fast
so then how was it last night
pandu uncle was very close to us
i can arrange for  lakh
dad i will call you back
hey listen
wherever man
while they share  rounds each
lets see how he gets the point
when is the funeral
where will we find a coach at such a short notice
we may not be fit
are you really a pt teacher i doubt it
did i say i wont help him
you dont worry okay
now it is the raid from boys
what can we do for the rest

booliya friends are all out now
ill make sure that i repay all of you
gambling is like that you win some you lose some

good night daddy
looks like hell play well may be hell score one or two points
im sorry if youre hurt
i can prepare you only if you listen to me

we would need your support for the finals as well
yes ive fooled you
i was a partner for a new bus service
as boys are all out
place is this
their self confidence game spirit and technique
final match has begun
you lied to me again
even my father grew up here
whose head is this

you know their plan
lets spend some time thinking about how to get the money
so play come on
doesnt matter you still get  rounds
yes thank you

okay its not necessary for me to come right
as for the remaining  lakhs

ive missed lot of things peter
we can at least do this much for pandu uncle bhaskar
someone inform the dead body as well
i am good sir can i get you a cold drink
when my wife returns
its okay when will your car be ready
i dont know how to answer them

cheers cheers
how did he pass
oh my god
yes kishore
both of them were in the hospital for long
come soon dear its getting late
if mom was here
this game has come to an interesting point rarely have we witnessed something like this
nowhere dad we just went out
we should see how mamus boys will defend
let us do some warmup exercises and strengthen your old muscles
he always said this place isnt just a hotel
we should always think before we speak
wait wait what about rest of the players
clapping up on stage is not enough
we are  years old
just few more minutes
must have drank last night
its been long since my hands have touched the dirt
chanting kabadi kabadi all day
within a month
if we take a step back then well lose the opportunity to win
i called him said hes on the way
now only  players left in booliya friends
what if i am dead
this is a small city
if your grandfather comes to know i let you play kabadi
tomorrow again
youre not in college right
i know that you are a good player
im creating a big mess
gautham and i were there
now i am a bit busy
the thing is
with the bonus points boys total is  points
seeing urwa kings mamus boys are losing their confidence
if you have money then come and sit here
i can give you the money
today he is screwed
i cant leave my family and sit here everyday
if you guys dont mind I have an excellent name for our team
instead it should feel like
so what are they bigshots send them out
i did not mean it like that
mamus boys will raid first
my son after all being called a kabadi player
people are not hungry or what
coach
quiet pandu uncle
yes raghu nothing has changed
its time to repay him for his good deeds
what more can we do
why is he playing blind
what are you waiting for
if i do who knows if ill get another  years to regret
it is not your future think about it
he is such a selfish fellow
cheers to our coach sanjana
what good job
now urwa kings will raid
but it ends here understood
ive made your entry
even a bank wont give  lakh interest for a  lakhs deposit
he wouldnt have slept all night
shes blessed with your talent
why are you acti ng like a fool
gautham has trusted good people
everyones waiting at the ground
now i am treated like rubbish
referee flips the coin
were they calling me mosquito
each one of you mustve had three quarters of a bottle right
but i wouldnt like to see you lose
madhav sir felt sorry about your grandfather passing away
so for boys team first man will get in
if its possible please do come
inaugral lamps have been lit
continue later
and theyve lost the toss too
doesnt play with a hothead like before
kabadi kabadi hold your hands properly
yes thats important
you are my coach at the kabadi ground not here
just give me a lakh
why are you acting like a wet lotus
raghu dont you wish his soul should rest in peace
but i think you should come once
please dont take my stuff
then you only go and play
my grandfather loved this place
so we dont have family we are beggars
yes dad
heads
what is this
raghu was swimming in the pond
they have shaken up a strong team like urwa kings
youre just a little girl
oh wasnt driving in the night
he is not a stranger dad
i called you because
you dont need bodyguards to play cards
but now i cant prove myself
repaying the earlier debts bad luck following you around
now what can we do
well choke up that laughing devil
oh my god its difficult
what you were making money got over so soon
but if i would have told you the truth you have let me play at all
this chilled out player seems to have cold feet
time out to urwa kings
i cant bear it when you get scolded unnecessarily
no problem right
its a good start for mamus boys in the second half
oh theyre in our spot
whatever you say
pandu uncle
he doesnt like borrowing money at all
i dont have money
oh so total
he kicks they lunge
god knows
bodyguard
but still you people are struggling
i was just thinking
he tell us that is it
were you there
sad news
whatever happens
will you be coaching all your life or what
leave this
if youll practice for some more time then youll find your form again
her mothers sicks she has taken the kid as well

whatever you say raghu it tastes just like it did back then
till date i thought footpath was meant for pedestrians
good evening how are you all
hey it is not like that
playing is okay but how do we win
when is the funeral
theyre not aware what diseases they will get if the mosquito bites them

welcome to the federal bank kabadi tournament organised by dakshina kannada district amateur kabadi association

bhaskar took his clothes and ran away
its been years since youve played
lets have our lunch together okay
 teams with the highest wins in their group will play the finals tomorrow
was to make people eat tasty food
no way raghu

we should keep a name for our team right
we heartily welcome him
looking at the urwa kings team boys seem nervous
nothing but i will never forget this day

till now i havent seen a team owner playing
kudla hasnt seen a tournament of this scale

sat through the whole night talked to me
what is madhav doing here
yes man play
we play ourselves
kudla warriors
whats the point of saying these things now

do you remember how strong our team was
urwa kings have qualified for tomorrows final match
bloody cheapsters
mamus boys get  points
it was tough when i was your age
ill sell the house with her permission
our life wouldnt have been posh but wed be happy
then i called the shop you hadnt reached there either
he is not at home either
with gods grace ive got a second chance
dad it would be good if you could come
just think how well we used to play
so this time he couldnt be saved
take your water bottle
kabadi kabadi

he says he cant then why are we arguing
i strongly doubt youre a pt teacher
what is this for
why didnt you tell us before
dont you have any cash
i didnt have any hopes with bhaskar
didnt i tell you its been long since we have played
mine
hes like a family member
so what were you guys saying

the way booliya friends are play it seems that they will gain a point
also i asked you to get one bunce what is this is it a bunce
dont get out until i tell you to
the troubled attract trouble
do you know my father
urwa kings scores  points
hasnt been answering calls since morning

if you guys are so keen to get ashamed then i hope you die of the embarrassment
and since they had no choice they put a whistle around your neck
first of all im getting a fever
kabadi is a very serious game
now ill show them the power of mosquito
from boys captain raghu has come to raid
is that the way you talk to your grandfather
there is no one for me im all alone
better to not have friends at all
gautham whats there to eat
he didnt appreciate it
i didnt understand
ill never lie to my father
did you call that
short cut method means
theyve consistently won the trophy for  years
get down then youll know who we are
so shall we begin
sometimes god gives us exactly what we ask for
this is a funny game isnt it

no salt no assault
raghu are you mad

cant get enough of mamus boys
kabadi kabadi kabadi
last player urwa kings madhav is raiding

your wife has come where is she
what farm chicken farm
reputation what about commitment this is gauthams money
its not like that
against them a new team mamus boys
brother pandu was a good human being
we dont even have a uniform
i dont know how to thank you people
she would have suggested what to do right
we thank the audience for being here
truly a champion side
i was eating that wada so
okay I will pick you up at  pm
so you have the highest capacity in the group right
no theyve taken him down
it is late dear
good job it seems
what happened
you can run  rounds
getting the life partner of your choice
tomorrow sharp at  alright dismissed
are you challenging me
this time ill not allow it
there are many in the world who have no strength
hes crossed the bonus line
will teach you
he will lose this hotel
brother we are his bodyguards
this day will never come back again
madhav sir owner of urwa kings is also present today
very sad
each player is exemplary thats why theyre so consistent
look at me
hes become world famous in our area
our opposition in the finals is madhavs team
yes kabaddi
what is wrong with you
come on
oh wow theyve got the point now both the teams are equal
he passed peacefully
easily done and mamus boys score  point
you saw yesterdays madness right maybe he doesnt need our help anymore
yes i feel very sorry for him
how about we go to pandu uncles cafe for breakfast tomorrow
he wants to construct a building here
youre at least a pt teacher what do we do
back in my playing days
are you not giving me the money
yes yes
bike isnt starting
he said you play like a little girl
Ill see you at the office
where were you
escaping from avinashs strength he has crossed the line
so you played even after knowing i wont approve of it
what if we help him out
after all were asking for it rightfully arent we
only to keep up an image
i am confident he will surely come
touched the first man and the third man
whats all this ruckus
im suffocating here you play safely
no ones hurt right
even if we practice its impossible for us to play like we used to
one minute Ill get more money
this is my regular place why are you worried
first time such a big tournament is being organized in kudla
someone records us uploads it on whatsapp too many problems
when we come full respect when our money gets over no respect
i never had the money
who is this
ask your people to be more careful
theres only one raid
dont know why but i feel we can do it
how much is the bet
lets not get ashamed like this
we cant leave gautham like this
no worries im very happy
mamus boys have played really well in the second half
or else at least  lakhs
you can leave as well
you guys just dont care
lets play well
yes they were calling you a mosquito
he had helped us guided us
my body feels tight from  and half its reaching  packs now
youve accepted your loss too soon
you go ahead
go fry two plates of banana podi
forget the past my reputations on the line
and fooled the kids
there is one person
take care of him till i get there myself
take off your glasses
he was the main reason we played so well
right now youre just not in form
now i want to say something
why do you have a cellphone
everything will be alright
sir if you coach and guide us we will definitely win
what did you say
who is he
ask this dog right here
what is going on in your brains
we play with  players its better that we leave
by the time the match gets over
bhaskar i cant see my eyes my eyes
today evening
respect needs money
i remember all those things i didnt forget
hang up
kabaddi
youve taught your daughter well
weve been waiting to start practice
we have already arranged about  lakhs
ill definitely play
he was really a great man peter
she just needs your support
place cut
just for that stupid game
gautham
you know it very well
but now it is not possible
have you ever played kabadi
needs to be careful since they havent scored yet
but its good i stopped
brother raghu where are you
did you understand
ive felt he is upset about something
no need to play the match now business seems good
 thousand for one
i wont repeat his mistake
yesterday you left us there itself
toss won by mamus boys
oh senior citizen

first you invite then you bite
bhaskar and i were talking and we thought
yes yes
we didnt meet him
didnt i tell you we cant play kabadi at this age

hes asked both captains to step up
makes urwa kings the strongest team
anyone can come and join huh who are these guys

just keep quiet bhaskar dont keep irritating
yes youd love to touch my feet right
then why do you need my book

thats the problem theyve got the cafes documents kishor
may i borrow your accounts book
cant you see this pipe

without him we cant play like we used to
if he were here he wouldve lost it
urwa kings are all out
play man
playing days means you dont play anymore
hey peter
mamus boys have won the toss and selected the court
i asked you to write
our defense has become too weak
so itll be difficult to attend
i dont know what happened to me last night
go in your undies now
but because of drinking habits they threw me out of the partnership
you think theyll just give us the money
but does he know where weve to go do you know
from mamus boys team their captain will be raiding first
brother bhaskar youve to come back up as well
a but we dont have enough money to donate to strangers do we
leave it
urwa kings are here
lets be serious how can we help him
call for boys
i spoke to pandu uncles grandson gautam
oh my god brother jairam
i have let you down i feel for it
theyve fallen into the trap of a guy
when you are raiding you need to say kabadi kabadi at least for  seconds
yes you are right
says it will pay off the loan
you knew my grandfather right
so well have to try a short cut method
we should drink tonight
its my lucking lucky day im not getting up
what are you staring at
now its up to us to do something
bhaskar has improved a lot now
urwa kings madhav gets a green card

didnt you say you have the highest capacity in the group
he is a famous guy
leave quietly or else
this is fried in ail
if his father will allow him
but now if you dont go to play

mamus boys have not just gained one but two points
why did we get his team
we can surely do it i guarantee it

two plates of banana podi in kudla cafe kay
yes thats right
dont feel bad that i am saying this
urwa kings have won this match effortlessly
where is the remaining amount
let me call gautu
so in total we have  lakhs
now first raid from booliya friends
during those days he was the best raider
we are happy if we get our money
youre right

you people carry on ill play water sports for a while
i am sorry for being dishonest with you dad
including this one theyve  points in all
right now gautu needs our support
but well definitely pull it in sir
so you are going to play today
now the kid has no one
after years i stepped on the field

when i was with pandu uncle people would respect me
was it because of grandpa
i cant believe hes come drunk
i guarantee you cant do it bhaskar
i am not stopping you
come on boys come on do it

alright so everybody bend down and touch your feet
to express your rage on the ground
get out move
good catch by mamus boys first man
hes facing tough times
youve reached finals it seems
after a cliffhanger mamus boys have won by just one point
you wouldve met him by now
should we wait or start
for runners up it is  lakhs
we cant beat them in the match
door is open
so when will you return the cash
thanks for dropping me daddy
that we cant tell peter
so ill test you first
dont show me your face
buzz off
oh work
weve met after so long
are you serious
i am good
admit me in a hospital
coming coming
we have to do something
then make me understand daddy
i will not leave any one of you
we dont have to win the tournament
so as if you are rajinikanth
why dont we organize our own tournament
lets meet here tomorrow share all our ideas see where it goes
and hes across

hed say if you cant repay them then it ruins the friendship
selfish fellow

you need some muscles up here too
bhaskar
underwent great difficulties
bhaskar we won weve won kudla caf
what if something wouldve gone wrong
applying such high interest rates is fair or what
ill never lie to my father because
the hospital bills ran up to  lakhs
urwa kings has scored one point again
i have grown up here
mamus boys captain has taken a super dive and they get  points
raghu give me  lakh
but wholl run behind you to recover that money
ive asked him to take extra care okay
im leaving good night
he said he will pick me up at  pm
okay
where are you going turncoat
when my father passed away
lets start why should we wait
on
i dont care what you do
take that cotton out of your ears then youll hear it
girl whats your experience
dad i am a good son
why is raghu fuming jokes on him
even he is my property
so he borrowed  lakhs from madhav
as you all know main thing in kabadi is breathing
i dont like people messing with my property
do you have any other tensions
lets go lets go lets go
and for winners it is  lakhs
i know what to do i have the confidence
thats why i didnt want to come
bhaskar bhaskar what happened bhaskar
let it be now how should we help gautu
this is a special game
urwa kings first raid is made by danny
no problem big ground ambulance can come in
okay
suggest something else
uncle i had to go home in an under garment
its actually  lakhs
the nervousness showing on their faces
everyone is requested to occupy their places on the ground
its been a long time since we last spoke

shut up you moron
hello gautum
i dont talk to mad people
just as we expected
the tournaments a few days away
can we do anything about it
as far as i remember we spoke last diwali right
in childhood days you got the highest amount of beatings
what has happened you people are still fit
everything is gone to waste
who lied to his father to play a silly game
whats up having a good laugh
change your dress after practice
will teach him
from today onwards your business with this caf and gautham is done
there is no point telling my sad story
madhav sir
but that wasnt enough
it has been years weve met
he doesnt have the cash raghu
come on guys
youre just a little girl who wont understand
i doubt that they will come
you dont have any other options
what happened dear havent slept yet
hell make promises and wont show up for the match
but why waste time coming here everyday
his grandfather needed the money not me
please tell her
brother raghu
i didnt want to spoil the hopes you had with me
good time pass
but i have got one super idea
ask him if  pm is fine
so what are you saying
we get drunk in a hotel dont watch what we say
how about
lets see if we become panthers or remain to be pandas
i think we shouldnt play
why are you saying that
we dont have any other option
i never felt so embarrassed in my whole life
and no excuses
okay ill play ill join you guys
is there any tension
dont hit him
but i know i didnt marry a coward
go let us go come
youre right
fifty
if we lose we lose
you have it right
she has a good future in sports
share it with us
what is the matter
hes not dead still fresh why worry
this is what youve been up to
you should see how well i play
i met your mother
urwa kings  point mamus boys  points
it is not this mistake
hes finding it difficult to breathe
i did not hear it
you know how we lost to them earlier right
how much time do you have to repay him
