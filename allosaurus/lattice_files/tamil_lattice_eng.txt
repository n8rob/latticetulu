The feelings in my heart when I see you
What a blessing
Tamil is the water of our community
Today I am asking you not to seek it
taking several feet
Chant the Renaissance
Those who fear anything in the world
Ilaiyaan cried like this the king of poetry
As said by the Vanji Ilaiyaan was startled
Happy Christmas
Get a job in government
The dominance of AD form  Fools
Poetry books like elixir in Classic Tamil
The kings son could learn all the skills
He would say that they are the essence of the Sanjeevi mountain
The body that has lost energy needs strength
He said go with a fear of desire
He and she will go to the private room
Smile Rule the world
My lunch box is missing
She said burnt After that she ran away
Will the donkey improve
In Tamil Nadu the summer is between April and July
The sun sets in the west of the world
Fusar who left Wansura lives
Your houseyour neighbor houses
They came to see the girl at our house yesterday
Dealing with death and forgetting it is better
After drinking four or five cups of
This is a text spoken by a Kasi Nagar poet
To spend the day time he plays the ball game
The old man fell asleep
I told him jokingly
I dont have any property By disease
The wound which has been burnt by fire may heal but a wound burnt by the tongue will never heal
Climb and look out over the world
The oasis is there and I am in the pial
Come and sit down as usual
Increase your knowledge daily
Looks like it wasnt expected
Its a bungalow chariot
Dont try the foolish behaviors at all
The diamond repository that glare the eyes
What happened Vanji Dont even know this
Am I talking right
I already know what earth is like
The rice doesnt taste of much
He got there by running and the old man followed him
Girl he is blessed with Ramanup to the sky
He will suddenly lift while above
Like a peacock she was ready to play
The house number is sixty two but
Why are you standing in the street
like the meaning of thirukkural whe you stand high
its like a peak
wondering when would I match
Learn while young
Hey lady standing on the sea bridge
The poor are like a leaf full of holes
My dear say aloud
There exist only two castes
poverty galore
Libraries needed throughout the country
Can the world suffer in misery
Intellectual knowledge takes priority before food
Roam not around like a pauper
Leave thy wife and go behind other women
 You go to Elanthaiyur
Bask in the evening sun
Let there be revolution and public eat blood soaked food
Oh that poor policeman
Let darkness go away from the Tamils life
Love to donate
What difference you noticed between the people in the world
Its calm and quiet in the assembly
Lets boil the milk and drink it said she
Gaining support doesnt give you a hold
Dont tortureto acquire wealth
I lost myself in these
He struggled to even swallow the soft pancake
Humiliation based on colour and religion
The stream and lotus welcome you
You like this
caressed his wifes headOh no
That love look from the dametowards him
vast universe
What a beautiful poem
Standing in the adjoining balcony
united they succeededjointly
The housewife with her stretched legs
pay the money and travel
There is no odour in the soil
I will cook well
The great Tamil peoples insensitive well being
Similar to the sea
As they grow
with all good virtues imbibed in it
forget not to weigh the pros and cons
Thou shall finish it well
You are equal to women
translate into Tamil for reading
creating captious argument
Didnt invite to eat
Dont do evil things
He and she bound by heart
Even if its your enemy dont ridicule him even if it is for a short time because it will hurt them A respectable person wont do it
I am unwell
Like a ferocious tiger lying weak
Like the hero banging the heavy door
The moon sparkling like silver streaks
Where are you now
Never play with a snake
Ilangovadikals father Emayavaramban Neduncheralanathan
Like the money grabbed by the cabaret dancer
The bright blue skyover there
Any day is a good day
Hi friend how are you
The poverty stricken labourers increased What could I do
As those superstitions
He slapped me
Would say temple development works
stand with pride
The taste caused concerns
will measure the sky as well the fishes in the ocean
both listened from here because
Saved the poet and the lover
Appearance diminished and gasping for breath
if you understand me
developed streets on the four sides
Appeared as if the dame is still sleeping
nothing wrong with the food
cleared his throat as if in the dark
hoping divine intervention observed rituals
Hey darling  what will you give me
I am not bothered about lifethundered the lady
Realise the truth with both eyes
Is there any other book in the world like this
town crier
The sound alerted everyone
I have stolen your eyes and thoughts
would have reached by now and would have taken it by now
Very talented with clear thoughts
Where is my money
hunger is gone when one dies as you say
understanding that we are the world
being clear that thoughts make man
will give what you needin that
Even if we are the losers
Dont share evil things as identified by men of virtue
Vijaya Rani is shameless
Am asking a doubt please answer suitably
Marriage preparations are going on in full swing
Speaking good words and without offending others will bring fame even after death
falling in love is universal so why object
never forget the past
never say a lie consciously if so said the same conscious will kill you forever
lost myself in your beauty
different rules for different people
moving its feet step by step the body swirling
going the wrong path he said
millions of people devoured on false things and got divided
Let this daughter of mine be compared to a Satan
Even the sea will dry if its water if it is not brought back as rain by the clouds
coming home in the midnight from another town
spreading his fame in the ten directions
speak fluently in Tamil without hindrances
Hey my girl friendwhos that who ordered destruction
Would have flown in the sky by now
on hearing the kissing lips separated
World cant exist without water
Oh What would the society think
When selfishness is gone there is no war
world is eager
people living in the wild too have love marriages
I am a learned man he said
greatness of the learned weakness of those not
suddenly stroke affected one side
dumplings in hand and injured mouth
The learned hail India
education leads to many opportunities
Lets do gardening
Those were the daysours
Oh beautiful and loveable hero
The help is big see its so big
in the name of god
When this sound fell on their ears
groom and twirl your moustache and point it upwards
my love is divine of the high order
the eyes seductively invite the hero
encountered the cow as she walked along
Righteousness shall be thy deed
The lady was the boon of the penance
Tamil is our right to our cultural root
milk oozing profusely
instructed to have the sword laced with poison ready
understanding its greatness
What else is the news
Nothing had noble thoughts
I have a different opinion
like the porcupine raising its quills
drowned in misery
The child shared thus
We have seen humanity ruling the world
saying  Dont shoot me
People who have casteism at their hearts and act accordingly
like Tamil and its mellifluous flow like the honey my dear baby you sleep now
Lets the crown the Lion today itself
The education obtained by selling all the property
The beautiful lady is not at fault
If he runs away with the money the other side
Like a dry leaf in a huge hall
making love cocooning in a soft bed
He was waiting in the grove
ate quicklyand exited
The door is very heavy he said
Analyze the thoughts in the mind
join in good company
Let the royal servants judiciously serve
My agricultural lands are there he said
burnt the poisonous plant
The lady seeing his lover perplexed
Let even the handicapped learn
Dont wander like a lazy dumb
The sparkling sky
The sun rising from the ocean
Let thy service to the society be unblemished
spilled the milk form the milk pot
As you grown in front of my eyes
Give it Give it quickly
like the tortoise cocooning itself inside the shell lets control the five senses
Theatre and playground
if the petitioner runs away the case is of no use
I will come first next time for sure
Oh my dear you love those two herbs
spoiled the love
a perpetual father
Oh moon if you have a pal please show me
Thought he was sad
The snake moves from the ground rapidly
Leftover food after eating
Oh you like the glowing sun who has come to bun the casteism
Your wife delivered at an auspicious she said
Whats in the book was
Will blabber that the kingdom will be his in a few days
Being educated will show you great even if you are small in life
Stand straight dont bend
shrubs potholes
flower in the garden cast in gold
Wheres the boy Hey you be here
Gone are those days when we had small canals for agriculture
Tamil was born along with the eternal sea
Dakshinayanam is a phase when the sunrise move towards Southeast
wage paid to the agriculture workers
As such he kept it there
Its known but just one thing
will they be able to oppose us unanimously
Sweet Tamil language
Without eve just thinking
Sunshine
As it minglesthe love
And they have reached near by
words without evil thoughts and words spoken by those have understood truth are good words
standing at the peak of equality
seeing into her eyes and holding her hands he stood
Not so nice in fact
will cut you to pieces and offer to the fox
Like a ball out of moms hand
will see the high hills gardens river and nature
our sweet Tamil language
I said enter in dont stand he went
Dont stand in a war zone
Kings horse travelling the whole country
Hein a holy country
The child with a swollen belly not speaking
She keeps on pinching me ever
Dont roam around towns stay put here
climbed down via the verandah
The misery of labour
Seen me roaring
The agitated state of the child
My blood for the country of love
Brought the dead alive then bowed before then 
Come lets see the Kings son
The moon in the sky over the river Sindhu
Saint Valluvar through this poems brought out the virtues to be followed
mind with evil thoughts
would say many words
On hearing these words Kuppan said Aiyo
When did this letter come
The child suffered from the diseaseShe said
The average climate in a place for thirty years is called seasonal
give up evil deeds
The young lady thus cried
Oh you young  flowering creeper
ignorance said the dames mother
no fear no fear no fear for ever
with abundant love like the vase expanse of the sea
That king disrespected the law
like depicting a beautiful life
folding cloths is a big job
without jobs and dying in hunger
laughed aloud like a dead body
people with good virtues on the women approaching them
those scenes if with compassion
threw me in the mud never said the reason
all the wealth spent in increased spend
Many thanks
Even the fire wood is wasted because
Tapping the currency notes feeling happy
Maid and the housewife
embrace dedicate yourself
Mom please come here
The tides in the sea are caused by the gravity of the moon
through the holes dropped some
people born in the land of five years
hair hanging like the tail of the mice
will jump over the sea due to intense love
search for those what is rationale and intelligent
emerald green pond
like recurring income
small issue but a life threat for us
Kept that too near the child
Can you do a help for me please

if you try to chase away superstition they may try to chase awayi would say

brotherinlaw in the opposite cow shed
at the end of the small wall
if the lady love express herself through eye contact
See your human race
roar aloud to the world
you unmarried lady you decide your future
placed the sword in the right hand
like a monkey which lost its tail
kuppan laid on the bed with this head down
She didnt learn the art of writing poems
small investments brings small profits thousands

Like the flowing Ganges and Cauvery opinions emanate from heart

Active interest he thought even before winking

A man without noble values is like good milk kept in an unclean vessel which gets spoiled

Through the rationalist way
The screen barred from seeing each other
