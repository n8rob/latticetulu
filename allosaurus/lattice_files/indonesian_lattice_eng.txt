I went shopping to the supermarket
Sometimes I go sometimes I dont
Tom looks happy
This is what Tom does for a living
I once climbed Mount Aso
This book is difficult because there are a lot of kanji
I told Tom to stop
Have you seen Tom
Tom saw a boy waiting at the bus stop
The school is on the hill
I love small and cute animals
I feel bad today
I took two photos
How long has Tom been there
I read a book a little then went to sleep
Many young people who release their adult life without a way out
What were you doing
Is this book written by Kenji
Thats life
We talked for a while
Who is reading
It must be love
I know he cant work anymore
I tend to forget the names
You finally succeeded in getting a job
I practice piano every day
Im staying at a hotel tonight
He fully agrees with us
Mr Yamada gave books to my younger sister
Some students came to the library
Look and listen to me
Is the seat empty
I borrowed Mr Kimuras phone
In fact humans cannot live without sleep
I name the cat Tama
Share your work with others
The table used many spaces in this room
I have to wash my hands right now
Because I didnt know what time it was I looked at the time in class
This meat is the cheapest
Tom said he would never talk to me again
This is not a threat
This can be used as a knife
I prefer baseball than soccer
The island was hit by a typhoon
Which way is this street
Did you want to eat something
I did not think that was true
Tom promised not to come late again
This river empties into the Pacific
I was riding behind a friends bicycle
Because today is busy Im very tired
My house is very close to the station
A woman whose husband dies is called a widow
Dont act like youre beautiful
Follow your heart
He lives next to my house
All right then see you again
Tom is preparing for dinner in the kitchen
How old are you Im sixteen
I was surprised by the sudden lightning
All roads end in Rome
The party is fun right
The butcher shop is cheap today
There is a nice park near my house
Tom might have left
Do you like everything
He studies English
We should eat to live not live to eat
Mother and father returned home
You cant use your cellphone in the hospital
