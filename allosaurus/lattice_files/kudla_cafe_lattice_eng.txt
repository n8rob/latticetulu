what is this for
weapon
couldnt find anything smaller
how about that wada
i was eating that wada so
leave this
hey gautu whats the matter who is he
two years ago before my parents passed away
the hospital bills ran up to 15 lakhs
both of them were in the hospital for long
underwent great difficulties
poor grandfather had to spend all his lifesavings on hospital bills
but that wasnt enough
finally he took a loan from madhav
he is a famous guy
why did he do so he could have spoken to us right
you knew my grandfather right
he doesnt like borrowing money at all
in fact he would advise against borrowing money from friends
hed say if you cant repay them then it ruins the friendship
even then
hey let him finish first continue gautham
so he borrowed 10 lakhs from madhav
on four percent interest
adding up to 20 lakhs now
how much time do you have to repay him
within a month
and what if you dont pay back
the cafes documents are in his possession
pandu uncle was mad or what
who gives original documents to borrow money
this place must be valued at 50 lakhs at least
not 50 lakhs
it’s actually 70 lakhs
madhav has our documents
says it will pay off the loan
he wants to construct a building here
i don’t know what to do
i don’t want to leave this place
i have grown up here
even my father grew up here
my grandfather loved this place
he took great pains to build this place
all he wanted to do
was to make people eat tasty food
he always said this place isnt just a hotel
instead it should feel like
i feel bad for the kid
children suffer for the sins of elders
then what should have uncle pandu done ask his son to let him die in the hospital
one does what he can right
its not like that
couldnt he consider other options
look there is no point talking about the past
now can we help gautu
ill ask my father if he can help
what more can we do
why do you have to do that
let try to do something
we have to do something
lets meet here tomorrow share all our ideas see where it goes
tomorrow again
what is this
i have got family
i cant leave my family and sit here everyday
so we don’t have family we are beggars
i don’t talk to mad people
you keep quiet
raghu just a few more days
we can’t leave gautham like this
he will lose this hotel
pandu uncle was always like a master for us
he had helped us guided us
its time to repay him for his good deeds
raghu don’t you wish his soul should rest in peace
youre right
but we need to think practically
did i say i wont help him
at best we can pool in money and help him out
what else can we do
this is not just about money
right now gautu needs our support
hes like a family member
but why waste time coming here everyday
let’s be serious how can we help him
even i am telling you seriously
we should try at least
let him go both of us will do something
selfish fellow
okay ill take your leave
he is such a selfish fellow
its okay let it be we force anyone
let it be now how should we help gautu
i wanted to have a word
the thing is
i spoke to pandu uncle’s grandson gautam
hes facing tough times
yes aasif
theyve fallen into the trap of a guy
now its up to us to do something
thats the problem theyve got the cafes documents kishor
now he has to repay almost 20 lakhs
very sad
what if we help him out
i feel sorry for his situation
a but we dont have enough money to donate to strangers do we
can we do anything about it
he is not a stranger dad
pandu uncle was very close to us
when i was in college i used to regularly visit kudla café
i remember all those things i didn’t forget
don’t you have any cash
i pay you a salary right do whatever you want with that money
i don’t have money to spend for all these things
now i am a bit busy
good night dad
pandu uncle
you wouldve met him by now
take care of him till i get there myself
what happened dear havent slept yet
i heard your conversation with grandfather
overhearing elders is bad manners my child
i dont know i want to
if mom was here
she would have suggested what to do right
do as your heart says
care about what others say
arent you growing up fast talking like an old lady
ill return your money anyhow
please dont take my stuff
get out move
you got your chances get aside
whats up having a good laugh
why is raghu fuming jokes on him
hes become world famous in our area
why what happened whats the matter
raghu was swimming in the pond
bhaskar took his clothes and ran away
uncle i had to go home in an under garment
everyone was staring at me shocked
i never felt so embarrassed in my whole life
uncle even you are laughing at me right
there is no point telling my sad story
to cover my body i had to use coconut leaves
on top of that a dog started chasing me
are you guys my friends
better to not have friends at all
raghu you should never say that
in one’s life friends are the most valuable gifts
did you understand
we should always think before we speak
sometimes god gives us exactly what we ask for
did you understand
uncle if he had to ask god for anything
he wouldve asked for his clothes back
left bend properly right
left right left right
hey it’s not like that
then how i find it difficult
see me i will show you
left right
left right right left
coming coming
lets spend some time thinking about how to get the money
scoot in
how come youre here you said you wont come
what i didnt come for you
so what were you guys saying
gautu how much cash do you have now
i have got 3 lakhs
youve got 3 lakhs
what can we do for the rest
i can arrange for 1 lakh
i have arranged for 1 lakh
oh all poor people are done
now let the boss speak
write 5 lakhs form my side
what are you staring at
dont have to pay immediately right later right ill pay
i asked you to write
weve to save him anyhow right
i don’t know how to thank you people
god blesses those who pick up the fallen
ill make sure that i repay all of you
then gautu’s 3 lakh
i ail raghu’s 1 lakh and 1 lakh from me
so in total we have 10 lakhs
as for the remaining 10 lakhs
do we have any ideas
is brain working
what is this you know weve to arrange 10 lakhs in a month
even a bank wont give 10 lakh interest for a 10 lakhs deposit
but i have got one super idea
place is this
this is my regular place why are you worried
i don’t find it safe feels risky
life is full of risk
bhaskar you know were in trouble right
the troubled attract trouble

she just needs your support
come pooja let’s go
bye dear
yesterday it was a bit too much
i know
gautham called me in the morning the matter
you saw yesterdays madness right maybe he doesnt need our help anymore
and whats bhaskars story today
hasnt been answering calls since morning
let’s go to his house
even if hes mad we need him right
look how hes parked peter
ring the bell there is a bell right
bhaskar
whats all this ruckus
did you sleep in the car the whole night
speak softly others might hear it
yesterday you left us there itself
gautham had called to meet up at the cafe
i don’t know why lets go and find out
oh parked it so far up front huh
oh wasnt driving in the night
who is he
even i don’t know who i came with at night
the car is just short of kissing the porch
kabaddi
i didn’t understand
yes kabaddi
you serve in plates right why are you serving me a newspaper
“getting the life partner of your choice”
“repaying the earlier debts” “bad luck following you around”
what is this
theres a kabadi tournament within 25 days
first time such a big tournament is being organized in kudla
many teams will come from different places do you know
so what should we do
a federal banks mangalore branch will be sponsoring this tournament
kudla hasnt seen a tournament of this scale
but how is it connected with us arranging the money
check the winning amount
for runners up it is 10 lakhs
and for winners it is 20 lakhs
so what are you saying
so if we assemble a team train them and if they win
you think theyll just give us the money
so what are you telling us
not assembling another team
we play ourselves
two masalas outside
shut up you moron
its not necessary for us to win
second prize is enough too our problem will be solved
what happened
why can’t you start playing again
how is this possible what are you saying
we havent played for thirty years
i know it peter
don’t know why but i feel we can do it
what is this are we playing carrom
its kabaddi we cant play this game anytime we want
hell make promises and wont show up for the match
bhaskar i know that
i have let you down i feel for it
but this is one great chance
do you remember how strong our team was
who is this
madhav
what did you tell
madhav sir
who are they your lawyers
i dont like people messing with my property
even he is my property
as revenge i can cut off your hand your leg or even your head
i will not leave any one of you
why work against the law when the law is with you
right gautham
youll get your money in due time leave him alone till then
yes thats important
we are happy if we get our money
after all were asking for it rightfully arent we
applying such high interest rates is fair or what
his grandfather needed the money not me
anyway just wanted to remind you that im still alive
okay then ill take your leave
hey listen
you know their plan
theyll win a kabadi match
kabadi
it might be good
but do you people have an idea about the game
gautham has trusted good people
good good
it is all good
kabadi is a very serious game
if you people join then it might provide some comedy
good time pass
okay i will leave now wont come back again
itll soon be mine this place
come man
were definitely playing kabadi
well choke up that laughing devil
yes you are right
i trust you people
even grandpa used to say how strong your team was
it was gautham look at us now
what has happened you people are still fit
look at me
i will play
we don’t have any other option
do you have other options to make 10 lakhs in such a short period
play man
playing is okay but how do we win
i strongly doubt youre a pt teacher
you mustve joined as a janitor
and since they had no choice they put a whistle around your neck
and fooled the kids
we don’t have to win the tournament
we just have to reach the finals
on
we have already arranged about 10 lakhs
runnerup is good too
no “if” no “but” peter
why peter can’t we play
just think how well we used to play
we can surely do it i guarantee it
yes man play
okay ill play ill join you guys
wait wait what about rest of the players
will they join us
see call them
i doubt that they will come
most of them said theyll come
god knows
wait for some more time
you people are here
aasif im glad you guys came
cant we do at least this much for pandu uncle
sorry i couldnt make it to the funeral
i felt really bad i wont miss anything now
come play
its been long since my hands have touched the dirt
we can see that with your stomach
kabadi kabadi
oh my god its difficult
difficult too difficult not as easy as we all thought
didnt i tell you it’s been long since weve played
but i didnt think well be out of touch so badly
i on you were all a team
right now youre just not in form
what farm chicken farm
not like that
if youll practice for some more time then youll find your form again
even if we practice its impossible for us to play like we used to
our team is missing one thing
what is it
your grandfather
he was the main reason we played so well
without him we can’t play like we used to
now what can we do
i think we shouldt play
you keep quiet man
search for a new coach
where will we find a coach at such a short notice
there is one person
i am sorry
i feel bad that i can’t help you
1 didn’t like your decision
don’t feel bad that i am saying this
youre out of touch for 30 years now i cant prepare you in 25 days
but we do play well sir our old team has regrouped sir
i know that you are a good player
i always respected brother pandu
1 but now it is not possible
he says he cant then why are we arguing
sir if you coach and guide us we will definitely win
i know our tummies are bulging out
but well definitely pull it in sir
im happy that youre playing
but i wouldnt like to see you lose
zz anyhow wish you all the best
thank you sir
when he wished us luck
i didnt understand if he was encouraging us or the opposite
how about we make money thi
no those things wont work
well how are we going to play kabaddi at this age
why dont we organize our own tournament
nothing seems to be working out
gautham whats there to eat
one minute
okay ive understood your situation

stomachs like a tire calls himself fit
you are a pt teacher right
nowadays even im doubting it
brother bhaskar will you listen to me come up
stretch go all the way down
brother bhaskarstop
your grandfather killed us
as you all know main thing in kabadi is breathing
when you are raiding you need to say kabadi kabadi at least for 30 seconds
great players practice for years to achieve that
its been 30 years since youve played you can’t do it
the tournaments a few days away
so well have to try a short cut method
short cut method means
whose head is this
i didn’t know well have to do all this
are you really a pt teacher
poor children
everyone doesn’t have to raid right
then whyre you testing our breathing limits
ours isnt a professional team
anyone might get a chance to raid
now get inside the water
don’t get out until i tell you to
any doubts
why do we need this test sink
are you people tired
i was just thinking
we should keep a name for our team right
how about kudla warriors
sounds like a herd of goats
i asked for a good name
kudla warriors
do you know the meaning of warriors
no salt no assault
suggest something else
how about
its scary for all the wrong reasons
if you guys don’t mind ive an excellent name for our team
what is it
may i suggest a name
its deadly seven
“mamu’s boys”
super name
its late shall we leave
go let’s go come

this is a small city
what did you think i wont come to know
this is what youve been up to
you lied to me again
just for that stupid game
youve taught your daughter well
how to lie to your parents
ill never lie to my father
what did you say
just what you heard
that i wont lie to my father
thats what i have learnt from him
you only see
this is how you brought her up
is this the way she talks to her grandfather
just have your breakfast
didn’t i ask you not to poke your nose when elders are talking
i can’t bear it when you get scolded unnecessarily
grandpa
ill never lie to my father because
he never gave me that opportunity
he used to listen to whatever i said
then he used to guide me
and never controlled me
if you want to be a good father
dont you understand
how many times do i have to tell you
is that the way you talk to your grandfather
everyones waiting at the ground
todays the final match we will be late
so you are going to play today
yes dad
today ill play
dad i am a good son
i love my daughter i love you too
i love my life too
just because i skipped that day ive been regretful for 30 years
with gods grace ive got a second chance
ill not repeat the same mistake dad
if i do who knows if ill get another 30 years to regret
if its possible please do come
its not that bad a game
that day you asked us to write 5 lakhs now youre saying you don’t have it
what happened tell me
ask this dog right here
will someone explain clearly
he doesn’t have the cash raghu
which money
the money which he said hell give
now he doesn’t have the money it seems
everything is gone to waste
don’t call it a waste peter
what is the problem in it
raghu are you mad
tomorrow we are just getting 10 lakhs
he said that he will give 6 lakhs right
5 lakhs to give and 1 lakh which he used for gambling
okay
is it right now we have 4 lakhs right
for 6 lakhs what are we going to do
you fooled us
yes ive fooled you
i don’t have the money
i never had the money
its been 3 months that my wife and son have left
i was a partner for a new bus service
but because of drinking habits they threw me out of the partnership
there is no one for me im all alone
i dont have the money raghu
i don’t have money
whats the point of saying these things now
why didnt you tell us before
i didn’t want to spoil the hopes you had with me
but now i can’t prove myself
leave it
everythings over now
our opposition in the finals is madhavs team
you know how we lost to them earlier right
everything is over
weve done our best but what to do
are you people finished is it over
since ive come here you people have been speaking nonsense
saying that well lose the game
peter we will win we have to win this
then you only go and play
i will not come
i can’t take another beating from them
hes right raghu
we can’t beat them in the match
if we take a step back then well lose the opportunity to win
whatever happens
ill definitely play
ill play today evening
if we lose we lose
once when i skipped the match i had to regret for 30 long years
this time ill not allow it
what if that day bhaskar would have forgiven me
would we have been away for so long
i wont repeat his mistake
we live happily with negative thoughts peter
today we are playing not just for the sake of café
there is something more than that
it is up to you people whether youre coming or not
ill not play
we can do it
ill play tonight
if we lose we lose
once when i skipped the match i had to regret for 30 long years
this time i wont allow it
brother raghu
they may not come
lets not get ashamed like this
lets go and tell the referee
youve accepted your loss too soon
look over there
aasif kishore
yes raghu
you were right
lets finish what weve started
where is bhaskar
didn’t he come here
we didn’t meet him
he is not at home either
we thought that he might have come here
we play with 6 players its better that we leave
federal bank final match will begin in few moments
inaugral lamps have been lit
everyone is requested to occupy their places on the ground
the most awaited final match will begin in few more minutes
i know someone
he said that hell help you guys
can i join you boys
thank you thank you
lets play well
come on boys come on do it
both the teams get in
toss won by mamu’s boys
mamu’s boys have won the toss and selected the court
so urwa kings will raid first
final match has begun
first raid by urwa kings captain danny
raider has won the first point
now mamu’s boys will do their first raid
mamus boys captain has taken a super dive and they get 2 points
urwa kings 1 point mamu’s boys 2 points
urwa kings strong raider ravi has stepped in
mamus boys left corners first mans effort has failed
boys unable to show yesterdays spirit
even if youre scared you should go
because the fault is all yours
even if you drink gamble
but i know i didnt marry a coward
but now if you don’t go to play
you will be a coward
what is wrong with you
where has your spirit gone
weve reached the finals but youre still not playing your real game
what gautham
what is going on in your brains
our defense has become too weak
i don’t care what you do
pull up your socks and get going
goodlooking trophy right
this trophy will be mine
the café will be mine too
its surprising that you oldies made it this far
admirable
but it ends here understood
okay then
if you guys are so keen to get ashamed then i hope you die of the embarrassment
its not enough if you just have strength in your body
you need some muscles up here too
body is about to collapse
but still you people are struggling
there are many in the world who have no strength
but make a livelihood
clapping up on stage is not enough
get down then youll know who we are
raghu
im sorry im late
if want to play in your team will you allow me to play
ive promised my wife that i wont cry
your wife has come where is she
at least for kudla café we have to win this match
give me your jersey
what are you staring at
are you going to play
do what i say
everything will be alright
after the half time
bhaskar has rejoined the mamus boys
and urwa kings owner madhav has also joined the team
first raid after half time is from bhaskar
and hes crossed the line
it’s a good start for mamu’s boys in the second half
now urwa kings will raid
an amazing attempt
no theyve taken him down
unbelievable sight as the strong danny captain of urwa kings is tackled by mamus boys
total score of boys is 10 and urwa kings is 25
mamus boys smart player is raiding
a beautiful play and boys get 2 points
now the urwa kings owner madhav is going for his first raid
till now i havent seen a team owner playing
this is a special game

urwa kings madhav gets a green card
if he repeats it a then madhav might get a yellow card
hell also get a 2 minute suspension
now it’s the raid from boys
escaping from avinash’s strength he has crossed the line
mamu’s boys get 2 points
last player urwa kings madhav is raiding
successful tackle by the second man
urwa kings are all out
boys are playing really well in the second half
